# ogre

Clojure wrapper for gremlin. Derived from
[Hermes](https://github.com/zmaril/hermes), inspired by
[Titanium](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/titanium). The goal of this
project is to provide a solid, well tested Clojure wrapper around
gremlin. To that effect, we aim to port most of the tests over from
gremiln itself. 

## Usage

For now, read the tests.
