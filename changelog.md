## Changes in Ogre 2.3.0.2

* `--E>`\`<E--` have become `-E>`\`<E-`. This enforces all shortened
  traversal methods to only be three characters long.

## Changes in Ogre 2.3.0.1

* `convert-to-map` is now polymorphic and converts Rows as well.
* Ogre is now a Clojurewerkz project.
* Traversals now take in a list of labels.

## Changes in Ogre 2.3.0.0 

Update Gremlin version to 2.3.0. `count` is now `count!` because it
executes the pipeline and returns all the objects. Type hinting has mostly
been added in.

## Changes in Ogre 2.2.0.0 

First release. Covers most of the library.
