# ogre

Clojure wrapper for gremlin. It was derived from
[Hermes](https://github.com/zmaril/hermes) and inspired by
[Titanium](https://github.com/clojurewerkz/titanium). The goal of this
project is to provide a solid, well tested Clojure wrapper around
gremlin. To that effect, we aim to port most of the tests over from
gremiln itself and eventually provide documentation. It powers
Hermes right now. 

## Usage

For now, read the tests.
